Hello! My name is Daniel Saenz Narvaez
I am a recent university graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Economics
The career track I would love to trek is Data Science because I love fortifying 
technical solutions with data.
Ultimately, I would love to combine my passion for data and my Economics education and 
work as a pricing analyst. 

This github's purpose is to showcase my proficiency with several programming languages
and to establish my skills as a new economist/ data scientist.
